# GameworldJEM
A multi-module Android project that showcases a plug-and-play top-down game screen built with Jetpack Compose. The :gameworld library renders Tiled maps (.tmj) with multiple external tilesets (.tsx/.tsj), handles camera, collisions, movement and sprite animation, and ships with a demo :app showing how to integrate it.
